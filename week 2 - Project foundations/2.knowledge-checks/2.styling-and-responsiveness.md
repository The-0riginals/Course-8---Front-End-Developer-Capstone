   The fr is a flexible length unit in CSS grid that grows or shrinks based on the available space in the grid. It is used to specify the size of grid tracks (rows or columns) in a grid layout. The fr unit is a proportional unit, meaning that it takes up a fraction of the available space based on the value assigned to it
