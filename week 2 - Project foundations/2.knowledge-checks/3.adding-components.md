 const myList = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

 const listItems = myList.map((item) =>

  <li key={item}>{item}</li>

 );

 return (

  <ul>{listItems}</ul>

 );
 ```
  ans:
  ```
  <ul><li>apple</li><li>banana</li><li>orange</li></ul>

  The code block creates a list of li elements using the map() function and then renders them inside a ul element.
  ```
