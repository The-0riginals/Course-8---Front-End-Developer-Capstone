1. Question 1 You are implementing a stateful component in your React project which will display the number of people living in your town. Which of the following React hooks should be used to update the state of the component?
 - setState()
 - useState()
 - useEffect()
 - setEffect()
 ```
 answer: useState()
 This is a built-in React hook which can define an initial state if a value is passed in as a parameter and also update the states through array destructuring of its returned array.
 ```
2. Question 2 Which one of the following statements is true about the useState hook?
 - To continuously update the state, arguments must be passed to the useState hook.
 - The pair of values returned by useState can be given any name.
 - The initial state of a component should always be defined as useState(0).
 - The pair of values returned by useState must be given strict names defined somewhere in your code.
 ```
 answer: The pair of values returned by useState can be given any name.
 ```
3. Question 3 What is the type of data which is passed from a parent component to a child component?
 - variable data
 - props data
 - mutable data
 - state data
 ```
 answer: props data
 props are passed from a parent to a child component, the child then does something with those props, whether it be updating what is rendered on the web page, or storing the data as state internally.
 ```
4. Question 4
True or False: Uncontrolled components are components that do not maintain their own state.
 - True
 - False
 ```
 answer: false
    Uncontrolled components are components that do not maintain their own state and rely on an external source for their state, such as a form element or a parent component. In contrast, controlled components maintain their own state and control their own behavior and rendering.
    ```
 ```
5. Question 5
Which React hook must be utilized when calling an API using the fetch() method?
 - useEffect
 - useState
 - useReducer
 ```
 answer: useEffect
 Using the fetch() method is considered a side effect because it is getting data from a third party, so the useEffect hook needs to be used.
 ```
6. Question 6
What will be output if the following HTTP request fails?
```
fetch('https://example.com/api/data')
  .then(response => console.log("Success"));

```
 - Fail
 - Success
 - Nothing will be output.
 ```
 answer: Nothing will be output.
 There is no catch function defined for the resulting promise, therefore, nothing will be output.
 ```
7. Question 7
Which one of the following is a valid command for running your unit tests?
 - run test
 - test npm
 - react test
 - npm run test
 ```
 answer: npm run test
 Running this command will trigger any tests written. An alternative command is ` npm test ` .
 ```
8. Question 8
Which type of form validation provides an immediate response to the user, usually as a validation message next to the form field?
 - Ad-hoc form validation
 - Server-side form validation
 - Client-side form validation
 ```
 answer: Client-side form validation
 Client-side form validation provides immediate feedback to the user. An example of this would be using regex to validate what is being typed into a text field.
 ```
9. Question 9
Of the four major elements outlined by the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), which one is mostly concerned with providing features such as screen readers and synthesized speech?
 - Understandable
 - Perceivable
 - Robust
 - Operable
    ```
    answer: Perceivable
    The Perceivable element is mostly concerned with providing features such as screen readers and synthesized speech.
    ```

10. Question 10
When importing the useState hook the common practice is to use object destructuring. If object destructuring was not used, and all we had was the code snippet below, how could the useState hook still be used?
 `import React from "react";`
 - React.useState
 - React.get(useState)
 - useState
 - It could not be used
 ```
 answer: React.useState
 The useState hook is part of the imported React library, and thus can be accessed using dot notation.
 ```
