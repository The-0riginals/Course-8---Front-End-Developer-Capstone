1. Question 1 What is the purpose of the useState hook in React?
 - To bind an event handler to an element.
 - To bind a value to the props of a component.
 - To manage the component's context
 - To manage the component's state
 ```
 ans: To manage the component's state
 explanation: The useState hook allows you to manage the component's state by declaring a state variable and a setter function for updating the state.
 ```
2. Question 2 What is missing from the code below?
 ```
 import { useState } from "react";

 export default function App() {
  const [restaurantName, setRestaurantName] = useState();
  return <h1>{restaurantName}</h1>;
 }
 ```
 - The setRestaurantName function.
 - An initial value for the state variable restaurantName
 - useReducer hook was not used
 - The useState hook import statement
 ```
 ans: An initial value for the state variable restaurantName
 explanation: The useState hook requires an initial value to be passed as an argument in order to properly bind a value to the state of a component. Without an initial value, the state variable restaurantName will be undefined and the component will not render correctly.
 ```
3. Question 3 Controlled components keep their internal state in the DOM
 - True
 - False
 ```
 ans: False
    explanation: Controlled components keep their state in the component's state. Uncontrolled components keep their state in the DOM.
 ```

4. Question 4 What is unit testing in React?
 - A type of testing that involves manually testing a component's UI.
 - A type of testing that ensures that a complete application is working as intended.
 - A type of testing that ensures that a component's props and state are correctly being passed down to its children.
 - A type of testing that ensures that individual units of code are working as intended.
    ```
    ans: A type of testing that ensures that individual units of code are working as intended.
    explanation: Unit testing is a type of testing that ensures that individual units of code are working as intended. Unit tests are typically written by developers and are used to test the functionality of a component's methods and functions.
    ```
5. Question 5 What is the main difference between the useState and useReducer hooks in React?
 - useState is used for managing component state, while useReducer is used for managing the component lifecycle.
 - useState is used for simple state updates, while useReducer is used for complex state updates.
 - useState is used for managing component state, while useReducer is used for managing the component's UI.
 - useState is used for managing component state, while useReducer is used for managing global state.
 ```
 ans: useState is used for simple state updates, while useReducer is used for complex state updates.
 explanation: The useState hook is used for simple state updates, while the useReducer hook is used for more complex state updates that involve reducing the current state and an action to a new state.
