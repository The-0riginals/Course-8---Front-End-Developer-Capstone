1. Question 1 Why should you never call hooks inside a nested function in react? 
 - To ensure that the component updates correctly   
 - To avoid unnecessary re-renders of the component   
 - Because hooks can only be called from the top level of a function component
 - To prevent memory leaks
 ```
 ans: Because hooks can only be called from the top level of a function component
 explanation: Hooks must be called at the top level of a function component, and not inside a nested function. This is because hooks rely on the order in which they are called to determine the state of a component. If hooks are called inside a nested function, the order in which they are called may not be consistent, leading to unexpected behavior.
 ```
2. Question 2 True or false. The fetch function should be used inside the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method or `useEffect` hook. 
 - True
 - False
 ```
 ans: True
 The componentDidMount lifecycle method or the useEffect hook is the perfect place to use fetch calls to ensure the component doesnâ€™t render before the external API data is received to avoid issues with the component not rendering correctly or with missing data being displayed.
 ```
3. Question 3 When you receive a HTTP response using the fetch() API, how do you parse the data into a JavaScript object? 
 - You should use the json() method of the response object to parse the data as a JSON object.   
 - You should use the JSON.parse() method to parse the response data as a JSON object.   
 - You should use the text() method of the response object to parse the data as a JSON object   
 - The fetch() API automatically parses the response data as a JSON object.  
 ```
 ans: You should use the json() method of the response object to parse the data as a JSON object.
 explanation: The fetch() API returns a response object that contains the data returned from the API call. The json() method of the response object is used to parse the data as a JSON object.
 ```
4. Question 4 Which of the following statements are true? Choose all that apply.
 - You can load local JSON files in your React project
 ```
 You can load local JSON files in the react project by simply importing them as you do for other JavaScript files.
 ```
 - The fetch() API call cannot make DELETE request
 - If the external API returns JSON data, you need to exclusively parse it in the fetch() API
 ```
 You need to use the json() method of the response object to parse the data as a JSON object.
 ```
 - You cannot make multiple fetch() calls in the useEffect hook
5. Question 5 Complete the sentence: JSON is ______________.  
 - A file format and a data exchange format    
 - Only a file format    
 - Only a data exchange format   
 ```
 ans: A file format and a data exchange format
 explanation: JSON is a file format and a data exchange format. It is used to store and exchange data in a format that is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate.
