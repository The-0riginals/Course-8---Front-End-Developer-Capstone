# This course consists of four modules:

## Module 1: Starting the project 
 This introductory module will give you some general information about the capstone project. You'll also review the process of setting up your coding environment, tracking your code using Git and setting up your UX/UI processes. The purpose is to guide you through setting up and beginning your work on the project.

 By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

 - Ensuring that your development environment is working and is set up to be as efficient as possible

 - Ensuring that you're tracking your project using version control, specifically Git and GitHub

 - Planning the UX/UI, including project wireframing, creating a component and applying design fundamentals in Figma

## Module 2: Project foundations
 The second module of this course begins with a revision of semantic HTML. You'll need to set up a semantic HTML structure for your app. As styling your apps is essential, in this module, you'll also need to write some CSS code, including setting up a reusable CSS grid. Styling is closely related to components; thus, this module will guide you in setting up your project's components.

 By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

 - Setting up your project's HTML structure and styling

 - Setting up your project's components

## Module 3: Project functionality
 In this module, you'll focus on coding interactive parts of your app. You will complete your app's functionality, your appâ€™s booking form with its own state, working with data and using APIs. Additionally, you'll improve the UX/UI of your app by further enhancing your users' experience through the evaluation and revision of its design. You will also address accessibility and form design.

 By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

 - Coding the table booking system, including state,

 - Working with forms to update your app's state through user input,

 - Adding unit tests to ensure your app works correctly as you code new features 

 - Working with some in-browser APIs to ensure more persistent data

## Module 4: Graded assessment
 In this module, you will be assessed on the fundamental skills covered as you build the capstone project's functionality. You'll have a chance to compare your code and your designs with your peers via a peer review, as well as work through a solution to some of the most challenging parts of the capstone project. At the end of this module, you'll complete a graded assessment, reflect on your learning and be guided to the next steps in your developer journey.

By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

 - A peer-review of some of your peers' projects

 - A graded assessment in which you synthesize the skills from this course

 - A reflection on your learning and the next steps in your developer journey
